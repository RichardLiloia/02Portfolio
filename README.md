My portfolio includes my name in a highly visible position and font style.  The tab up top for the web page is entitled, “Rick’s Portfolio.”  In a traditional and useful spot for the nav bar, I have self-described buttons that will take you to different parts of the page when you click on them.  Below the nav bar to the left are the titles which I will have when all I complete all of my training.  (It says “Web Developer & Social Media Manager” in fairly large, italicized text.) Just to the right of my titles, you’ll find a recent, headshot-style photo of myself.  Continuing on to the right of my photo, is a very descriptive write-up detailing my background, skills, and prior experience.  Further down the page, in the “Projects” section, you’ll notice three photos, the first being a live link to my deployed “Run Buddy” page, and the others being placeholders which I’ll be substituting with more exciting projects as I complete them.  The final section which is towards the bottom of the page, beginning on the left side is my contact information, including the address of my LinkedIn profile.
