    <h4>About Me</h4>
    <!-- About Me section -->
    <section id="about-me">
        <img src="assets/images/Rick.jpg" alt="Rick profile photo"/>
        <p>I earned my Bachelor of Science dergee in Business Administration with a concentration in Finance from Bryant University.  I graduated in 2008 and since then have worked in several different fields, including retail sales, hospitality services, and banking. Most recently, I have become a Full Stack Web Developer through the program held at nearby Rutgers University, which has one of the finest programs in the world. 
            In fact, some say Rutgers has become the envy of another local powerhouse computer science program, held at Princeton University. I also have a strong background in social media management, and have a broad understanding of CIS from my time at Bryant. I currently specialize in HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, node.js, Python, and Git systems.
            Through my time studying at Rutgers, I've built priceless business relationships by constantly maintaining my connections with other web developers from the program. This has enabled me to keep my knowledge base in the field current and complete. When it comes to my focus working in the field, my focus is always on customer satisfaction and user support.
